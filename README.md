## 📄 Academic Status
* **Preprint**: need long time.
* **Status**: $O(n)$ complexity achieved, improving upon the classic Myrvold-Ruskey logic.

## 💻 Source Code
The core C++ implementations of the algorithms can be found here:
* **[map_perm_algorithms.cpp](./map_perm_algorithms.cpp)**: Includes `Position_unrank`, `Position_rank`, `PositionPro_unrank`, and `PositionPro_rank`.
* **[permpro_full.cpp](./permpro_full.cpp)**: Serves as a high-performance reference implementation for generating all permutations of a set using the **PositionPro** iterative algorithm. 

## 🛠️ Usage
These algorithms achieve $O(n)$ time complexity by optimizing the indexing logic $D[i]$, providing a more efficient alternative to the classic Myrvold-Ruskey method.

## 📚 Background & Acknowledgments
The **Position Pro (PP)** algorithm is built upon the foundational work of **Wendy Myrvold and Frank Ruskey**, specifically their $O(n)$ unranking algorithm (2001). 

While the MR algorithm uses a specific swap-based approach, the PP method introduces a more intuitive indexing logic $D[i]$ that simplifies the implementation and enhances understanding of the mapping process.

## PositionPro: Iterative Permutation Generation

The **PositionPro** algorithm is a high-performance, iterative approach to generating all permutations of a set. By utilizing an iterative state machine rather than traditional recursion, it significantly reduces function call overhead and optimizes CPU branch prediction efficiency.

### Key Features
* **Iterative State Machine**: Eliminates recursion depth limits and stack-related performance bottlenecks.
* **Hardware Affinity Binding**: Includes native Windows API support (`SetThreadAffinityMask`) to lock execution to a specific logical core, minimizing context-switching noise and cache misses.
* **High-Precision Benchmarking**: Performance is measured using the Windows High-Precision Event Timer (`QueryPerformanceCounter`) for nanosecond-level accuracy.

### Performance Benchmarks

The following results were recorded on a single core of a mobile-class processor. Despite the modest clock speed, the algorithm maintains massive throughput, processing over a billion permutations per second.

**Test Environment:**
* **CPU**: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U @ 1.80GHz
* **Affinity**: Bound to Core 3
* **OS**: Windows 10/11
* **Compiler**: GCC/MinGW with `-O3` optimization

| $N$ (Size) | Total Permutations ($N!$) | Execution Time (Seconds) | Throughput (Perms/Sec) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **12** | 479,001,600 | **0.272373** | ~1.75 Billion |
| **13** | 6,227,020,800 | **3.696829** | **~1.68 Billion** |
| **14** | 87,178,291,200 | **48.328881** | ~1.80 Billion |

### Analysis
The results demonstrate exceptional instruction-level parallelism. On the i7-8550U platform, **PositionPro** consistently achieves a throughput of approximately **1.8 billion permutations per second**, showcasing near-linear scaling relative to the mathematical complexity $O(N!)$.

## 💡 Future Ideas & Extensions

### 1. Zero-Memory "Lazy" Permutation
Since we can determine any value at position `k` in O(N) time without generating the full array, we can implement a **Lazy-Loaded Permutation Object**. 
- **Use Case:** Accessing elements of a massive permutation (N > 10^6) that exceeds RAM capacity.
- **Concept:** Overload `operator[]` to call `PP_get_value_at_position(k)` on the fly.

### 2. SIMD-Accelerated Partial Search
The backward-tracing logic `if (C[i] == current_target_pos)` is highly vectorizable. 
- **Idea:** Use AVX-512 to scan 16 elements of `C` simultaneously.
- **Goal:** Achieve near O(1) perceived latency for individual element lookups.

### 3. Distributed Constrained Search
Leverage the independence of the `get_value` function to split a single permutation validation task across multiple CPU cores or network nodes without shared state.

## 💡 Why Position Pro?
The **Position Pro (PP)** algorithm provides a more intuitive $O(n)$ implementation compared to the classic Myrvold-Ruskey (MR) method:
* **Simpler Indexing**: Replaces the traditional swap-based unranking with a direct mapping logic.
* **Educational Value**: The provided visualizations make the complex mapping process easy to understand.
